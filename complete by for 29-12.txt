10. Complete flow by 7:30

Components:
1. Compute for AzureML 
2. Azure Datastore training files store
3. Azure ML app + MLFlow
4. fUNCTIONS created - needs to be tested
5. Model endpoint for cardio created


Tasks:
1. Multiple models for a prediction - model selection + hyperparameter tuning.
2. Perform for 3 or all the models:
Try: 
Create new expt. for each of the predictions, run, so that the model is fit.
3. Code for data streaming- if you still don't know which is Azure Functions, use ADF.
4. ETL + DB storage

Next tasks:
1. Model run the data
2. Docker
3. FASTAPI/ Streamlit
4. Azure ACI
5. CI/CD this flow
